Connection Lines are the lines that go from one polygon to the other, following the peptide sequence. This lines can have their width and gray range adjusted.

The Spiral Factor determines if every polygon should be a little closer to the center of the circle than the one before it, organizing them over a spiral, instead of a circle. The Nesting Factor regards the distance between circles (or spirals) if more residues than 18 (or Period) are present. 

Other parameters ajust the properties related to the physicochemical characteristics of the helix.

The Figure Size group of parameters is important when it's necessary to change the size of the image following changes to the Legend and the addition of a Title.
