The groups tab can be used to change how amino acids are divided into 5 different groups.

The default approach considers all residues inside one of the 4 groups according to polarity and acidity, and one extra group for unknown residues. This can be changed, however, as needed. For instance, it can be considered that Glycine is a special case, given it's minimum side-chain, instead of a nonpolar residue. This can't be used simultaneously with a Unkown Residue group, however.

Note that all characters used in the sequence MUST be located in one of the 5 groups, or the projection will not be generated. Whitespaces, albeit discouraged, are allowed.

This tab also allows the definitions of possible interactions between residues, which are on of the main features of the Net projection. Nonpolar and hydrogen-bonding residues interact with residues of the same type, while Acid/Basic residues will interact with each other. Again, this can be used for different meanings, as long as the interactions pairs are maintained (Nonpolar/nonpolar, H/H, Acid/Basic).
