This tab is used to set the parameters of the polygons used to represent each amino acid residue in both projections. The options are all available by group, and a pretty straightforward.

The Pattern tab is only meaningful for circles, and is used to add lines to them, which can be specially useful for black and white images. 

Colors are set using hexadecimal codes, which can be easily created from the color picker. This is also valid for every other color option used in the application.
